Lagan user example (work in progress)
-------------------------------------

An example project that shows how to create user accounts, let them log in using sessions, and reset their password if they forget it.

This project is built on the basic Lagan project (https://github.com/lutsen/lagan), and only includes the extra files you need to add to this project.


Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.land/) from [HoverKraft](http://www.hoverkraft.nl/), and started as the backend for [Cloud 9](https://www.cloud9.world/).
